# URL-Resolution-Scheduler
This is a web-based URL resolution scheduler application that allows users to upload CSV or XLSX files containing campaign URLs, countries, notes, and user agent types. The application schedules jobs to resolve these URLs using BrightData proxies, fetching the final redirected URL and IP geolocation data.
